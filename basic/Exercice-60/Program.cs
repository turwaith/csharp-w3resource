/*
Write a C# program to calculate the sum of all the intgers of a rectangular 
    matrix except those integers which are located below an intger of value 0.
    Sample Example:
    matrix = [[0, 2, 3, 2],
    [0, 6, 0, 1],
    [4, 0, 3, 0]]
    Eligible integers which will be participated to calculate the sum -
    matrix = [[X, 2, 3, 2],
    [X, 6, X, 1],
    [X, X, X, X]]
    Therefore sum will be: 2 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 14
